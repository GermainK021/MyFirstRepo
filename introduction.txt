Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi, my name is Jimmy. I'm currently learning GitHub and version control as part of my development journey. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building projects that challenge me.

I'm excited to start contributing to real-world projects and collaborating with other developers. This repository marks the beginning of my GitHub experience!
