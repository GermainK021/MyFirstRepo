I have learned a lot about the collaborative power of Git and GitHub. What I have learned in this course specifically, understanding how to fork a repository, make changes in my local copy, and then propose those changes back to the original project via a pull request has been incredibly insightful. It's a clear workflow for contributing to open-source or team projects.
